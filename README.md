## Getting Started

*  Create a new GitHub repo called Word Guess Game or Psychic-Game, in accordance with the assignment    you choose to complete. Then, clone it to your computer.
*  Inside your local git repository, create an index.html.
*  While still in your local git repo, create a directory called assets.
*  cd your way into the assets folder, then make three additional folders: javascript, css and images.
*  In the javascript folder, make a file called game.js. Use the src attribute of the script tag to      link to this file, rather than embedding the code directly in your HTML document.
*  In the css folder, make a file called style.css.
*  Also in the css folder, make a file called reset.css. Paste into it the code from the Meyerweb        reset stylesheet. If you opt to use Bootstrap instead of writing your own CSS, skip this step, and    simply include a link to Bootstrap via CDN.
*  In the images folder, save whatever images you plan on using.

## Game Function
*  Guess what letter I'm thinking of
*  Wins: (# of times the user has guessed the letter correctly)
*  Losses: (# of times the user has failed to guess the letter correctly after exhausting all guesses)
*  Guesses Left: (# of guesses left. This will update)
*  Your Guesses So Far: (the specific letters that the user typed. Display these until the user          either wins or loses.)
*  When the player wins, increase the Wins counter and start the game over again (without refreshing     the page).
*  When the player loses, increase the Losses counter and restart the game without a page refresh        (just like when the user wins).
